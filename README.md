# Skin Cancer Classifier

This project started as a nanodegree mini-project, but it became my contribution to the researches in the usage of deep learning in dermatology.

Its goal is to correctly classify a potential skin cancer given only a macroscopic image an the epidermic lesion, so in the future, it can assist dermatologists in day-to-day diagnosys.

To achieve that, I used the [HAM10000 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10417).
